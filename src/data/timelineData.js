From this void, the Tree of Life emerged, its branches giving birth to the first creations: the universe, stars, planets, and the gods themselves. Among the earliest offspring of the Tree were two gods: Khaelos, the god of entropy and decay, and his younger brother Aureon, the god of life and creation."

It was a golden age of balance, with Khaelos ensuring the cycle of life and death while Aureon and other gods created new life and civilizations. Mortal creatures thrived under their respective gods' protection. During this era, there was peace among the divine beings, each god ruling over their creations."

        content: "By 2030, humanity's thirst for power leads to the development and use of weapons of mass destruction. To end their wars, they instead destroy much of the planet, poisoning the world with radiation and reducing civilizations to ash. In the wake of the atomic bombs, Aureon, devastated by the destruction, is petrified. His body was turned to stone in the form of a child statue, placed at the heart of a massive crater left by the bombs. His state jolts Khaelos from his slumber."

Supply chain disintegration occurred when shipping routes changed weekly. Currency became worthless as nations lost the ability to maintain stable borders. Billions became climate refugees, fleeing not war zones but geologically unstable areas. Government maintenance became impossible when capital cities relocated into new ocean systems. Satellite networks malfunctioned as GPS coordinates became meaningless. Internet backbone cables snapped due to ocean floor shifts. Power grids failed when transmission lines exceeded breaking points. Cell tower collapse from constant seismic activity. Ecosystem mixing occurred as Arctic species encountered tropical zones and deep-sea creatures beached due to ocean floor elevation changes. Agricultural collapse resulted from unpredictable growing seasons. Disease outbreaks emerged from population mixing without immunity plus new pathogens from disturbed ancient permafrost and deep earth layers."
