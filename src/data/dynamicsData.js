<div class="info-text">Issued: June 2035</div><br>
<div class="info-text">Classification: Global Health & Ethics Regulation | Public Documentation</div><br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Subject: The Ethical and Medical Consequences of Cybernization</div><br><br>
Cybernetic modifications, whether voluntary or involuntary, have been deemed a severe violation of human biology and integrity. As established by the International Health Order (IHO), the consensus among medical experts and bioethicists remains clear: the human body does not adapt well to such intrusive alterations. The widespread issues associated with cybernetic augmentations have led to their classification as unethical and medically hazardous.<br><br>
Numerous studies have demonstrated that cybernetic integration results in profound medical complications, including but not limited to:<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Unbearable Phantom Pains:</div> Individuals with cybernetic augmentations frequently report extreme and persistent phantom limb pain, far surpassing standard post-amputation pain syndromes.<br>
<div class="error-text">Neurological Rejection:</div> The human nervous system struggles to interface with cybernetic components, often resulting in chronic neuroinflammation, seizures, and unpredictable motor dysfunction.<br>
<div class="error-text">Psychological Deterioration:</div> Cases of dissociation, severe depression, and psychosis are disproportionately high among cybernized individuals due to the body's rejection of foreign machinery.<br>
<div class="error-text">Immune System Collapse:</div> The introduction of mechanical and synthetic elements into the body has led to severe autoimmune disorders, causing organ failure, infections, and systemic degradation.<br><br>
As unanimously agreed upon by all sovereign states in The 2035 Global Accord, the deliberate weaponization of cybernetic enhancements is strictly banned. Any individual, organization, or government found engaging in cybernetic warfare, forced augmentation, or biological-technical hybridization for combat purposes will be subject to the highest form of punitive action, including capital punishment.<br><br>
The use of cybernetic modifications in military, paramilitary, or criminal applications is considered a direct violation of international law and will be met with immediate and decisive intervention.<br><br>
The IHO recognizes that in certain cases, cybernetic implants may be the only option for survival following catastrophic injury or medical conditions. Therefore:<br><br>
Life-preserving implants (e.g., neural pacemakers, artificial organs, exoskeletal supports) are approved and highly recommended for those in need.<br>
Forcible augmentation—where an individual is harmed to necessitate cybernetic intervention—is inhumane, unethical, and strictly illegal under international human rights law.<br>
All medical cybernetic interventions must be conducted with full informed consent and strictly regulated to prevent abuse.<br><br>
In light of the devastation caused by recent global conflicts, all participating states are mandated to provide prosthetic limbs, exoskeletal supports, and rehabilitative care to those who require them.<br><br>
These measures ensure that war survivors, disabled individuals, and those affected by industrial accidents receive necessary support without coercion, experimentation, or unethical augmentation practices.<br><br>
The International Health Order urges all governments to uphold these standards, ensuring the dignity, safety, and autonomy of all individuals in the post-war world.<br><br>

Only one of the two crystals can be obtained through the lore story post or in-roleplay, but only one per person.<br><br>
Any additional crystals can only be acquired as event rewards (again, one per person, not per character) or with mutual approval from the co-owner and I.<br>
<div class="error-text">You CANNOT wish for it.</div><br><br>
It's important to emphasize that obtaining these crystals is extremely difficult.<br><br>
Climbing the jagged mountains or descending into dangerous caves is hard on its own.<br>
Successfully extracting the crystal and making it back to safety is even harder.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">YOU DO NOT SIMPLY APPEAR THERE, BREAK A CRYSTAL AND YOU HAVE IT.</div><br><br>
Simply put: no struggle, no crystal.<br><br>
<div class="info-text">Cryolith Crystals (Ice)</div><br><br>
Cryolith forms in the Faultline.<br>
Within the deep fissure, atmospheric gases and moisture crystallize into dense, unmelting ice under immense pressure and freezing temperatures.<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Properties:</div><br><br>
Absorbs and dissipates heat, making it impossible to use in high-energy or combustion-based applications.<br>
Unmeltable by conventional means; only plasma can nullify its structure.<br>
Prolonged exposure to Cryolith lowers ambient temperatures, potentially causing frostbite or hypothermia without specialized training or equipment.<br><br>
<div class="info-text">Zephyrite Crystals (Plasma)</div><br><br>
Zephyrite forms atop the Fractured Peaks.<br>
These peaks are wracked by geomagnetic thunderstorms caused by distortions in Earth's geomagnetic field. The storms release surges of ionized energy, which condense into volatile Zephyrite under specific atmospheric pressures.<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Properties:</div><br><br>
Pulses with trapped plasma, making it the only known material capable of powering high-energy weapons like Q's revolver or Silver's sword.<br>
Highly unstable; improper handling can cause catastrophic energy discharges.<br>
Emits a faint electromagnetic hum, disrupting compasses, radios, and unshielded technology. Prolonged contact can cause burns or nerve damage.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Nullification Effect</div><br><br>
Direct contact between Cryolith and Zephyrite results in a violent reaction, neutralizing both materials and releasing destructive energy bursts.<br><br>
These can manifest as localized EMPs or freezing shockwaves, which can damage equipment and harm nearby individuals. Over time, the crystals can regain their properties if kept apart.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">THE TWO CANNOT COEXIST</div><br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Weapon Applications:</div><br><br>
Q's revolver is the first and only functional plasma ranged weapon.<br><br>
Plasma from a Zephyrite-fueled gun is energy projected at high velocity. It is not a direct interaction with the crystal itself but a manifestation of the energy it generates. Therefore, nullification does not apply.<br><br>
You CANNOT make a Cryolith gun, as the bullet shoots through heat and pressure.<br><br>
Cryolith weapons require the crystal to remain intact for their effects to work.<br><br>
They are solid and interact physically with their targets, meaning nullification only occurs if the Cryolith and Zephyrite crystals make direct contact.<br><br>
Those who have Cryolith or Zephyrite are treated as pseudo-nobility in NML, but they also often face envy, suspicion, or outright hostility from others.`

It exists to tackle high-ranking outlaws and criminal threats that span multiple territories.<br>

Bounty hunters work closely with local police and Interpol, equipped with official badges and IDs to legitimize their role.<br>
They are bound by a rule: outlaws must be captured alive.<br>

• Old electronics maintain high value despite fragility<br>
• Pre-war materials (stable concrete, quality steel) are valued equivalent to their weight in credits<br>
• Fuel scarcity makes mobility equipment (quality boots, lightweight shelter) more valuable than fuel itself<br><br>
Universal hypervigilance and anxiety disorders make mental health care one of the most critical services available.`

        title: "MATERIAL INNOVATION",
        content: `The optimal scrap materials have been depleted after four decades.<br><br>
Communities now employ "layered salvage" techniques using concrete rubble foundations, twisted rebar structural frameworks, filled with newer materials.<br><br>
This creates brutalist architectural styles born from necessity.<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Biological Materials</div><br><br>
With traditional manufacturing eliminated, biological materials dominate construction:<br><br>
• <div class="info-text">Mycelium construction:</div> Fungal networks grown into specific shapes for insulation, lightweight panels, and electrical components<br>
• <div class="info-text">Bamboo derivatives:</div> Fast-growing, versatile construction material<br>
• <div class="info-text">Bacterial concrete:</div> Self-healing cement created by bacteria that strengthens over time<br>
• <div class="info-text">Grown plastics:</div> Algae-based polymers cultured in bio-reactors<br>
• <div class="info-text">Rebar-root composites:</div> Metal reinforcement with living plant fibers that strengthen over time<br>
• <div class="info-text">Glass-fiber concrete:</div> Melted bottle glass mixed with cement for stronger, lighter blocks<br>
• <div class="info-text">Metal-fabric weaves:</div> Salvaged wire mesh embedded in bio-textiles for flexible but strong walls<br><br>
Materials are universally hybrid by necessity.<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Clay Applications</div><br><br>
Clay represents abundant, versatile material with scrounged fuel kiln capability:<br><br>
• Radiation-shielding ceramics using specific clay compositions<br>
• Heat-storing thermal ceramics for passive solar heating<br>
• Water-filtering ceramic systems crucial for survival<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Resource Prioritization</div><br><br>
After decades of experience, optimal material priorities have been established:<br><br>
<div class="success-text">High Priority Materials:</div><br>
• Aluminum: Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, infinitely recyclable<br>
• Copper: Essential for electrical systems, antimicrobial properties<br>
• Titanium: From medical implants or aerospace applications, incredibly durable<br>
• Magnets: From electronics, crucial for generators and motors<br><br>
<div class="info-text">Textile Systems:</div> Paracord-based construction where everything is woven, knotted, or lashed together. Layered fabric systems use multiple thin layers instead of thick materials for easier replacement and repair.<br><br>
<div class="info-text">Advanced Infrastructure:</div><br>
• Piezoelectric walkways generating electricity from foot traffic<br>
• Thermal mass walls storing heat during day, releasing at night<br>
• Wind-responsive surfaces and building skins capturing air movement for power generation<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Restricted Use Materials:</div> Some items are too valuable for casual use:<br>
• Silicon chips: Reserved for crucial AI/communication systems<br>
• Medical-grade steel: Reserved for surgical tools and water purification<br>
• Optical fiber: Hoarded for essential data transmission<br>
• Carbon fiber: Used only for critical structural elements`

        title: "THE AVARIS SYNDICATE",
        content: `<div class="warning-text">Origins & Ideology</div><br><br>
The Avaris Syndicate traces its origins back to the pre-apocalyptic era, where it existed as a corporate conglomerate.<br>
It operated behind the scenes, amassing immense wealth and influence by controlling key resources, espionage networks, and entire economic systems.<br>
The Syndicate operates on opportunism, manipulating conflicts, and profiting from chaos. They seek absolute control over trade, wealth, and power, viewing themselves as the rightful rulers of what remains of civilization.<br>
They harbor a deep disdain for those they consider "lesser," such as mutants, cyborgs, exoskeleton users, and even individuals with prosthetics, whom they view as abominations to humanity's purity.<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Criminal Operations</div><br><br>
<div class="error-text">Black-Market Weapon Dealing</div><br>
Selling stolen or scavenged technology, as well as AoP-purchased weaponry, to any faction willing to pay.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Human Trafficking</div><br>
Exploiting desperate survivors and abducting others.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Espionage and Blackmail</div><br>
Gathering intelligence to manipulate both governments and rival factions.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Energy and Resource Monopolies</div><br>
Controlling essential supplies.<br><br>
<div class="error-text">Sabotage and Propaganda</div><br>
Undermining unity among factions and spreading false narratives to sow discord.<br><br>
<div class="warning-text">Tactics & Strategy</div><br><br>
The Syndicate excels in playing the long game.<br>
They're known to fund extremist groups to destabilize governments, only to betray them to authorities when it serves their purpose.<br>
They profit from wars by arming opposing factions and they're known for manipulating authoritarian regimes and opposing factions to keep global power in constant flux. Nations and factions regard them as a parasitic force, thriving in the chaos they help create.<br><br>
Their ultimate goal is not destruction but control, a complete monopoly on the remnants of civilization.`
